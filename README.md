# Hospital_Ranking_Using_R
The data used for this project is from the Hospital Compare website (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov) run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. This project will rank the hospitals from each state in the U.S. according to their 30-day mortality rates for heart attack, heart failure and pneumonia.
